presentations or medium articles.

# Modules, article links / slides

<b>master</b> branch contains latest state of the project with all branches merged, 
but at the time articles were created, some older versions were used (and maybe even some 
bugs existed in code :) ). Every article is usually 
referencing specific branch that is not deleted after merging (and thus can be outdated)
